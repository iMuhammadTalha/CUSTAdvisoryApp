1.	Introduction
In most institutions of higher education, faculty members are required to assume the role of academic advisor. Greater interest in advising has developed because of the growing complexity of higher education institutions, because of the ever increasing threat of declining enrollment, and because of the diversity of the students enrolling in the universities. Once viewed as a set of scheduling procedures, academic advising programs have been established to assist students in the development of their human potential.



2	Overview
CUST has an excellent reputation for the student experience, and our students report high levels of satisfaction with the academic and pastoral support they receive from staff. Central to the University’s approach to student support is this Advising system. 
The CUST Advisory App aims to support students in achieving their academic and personal development and prepare students for graduate employment or further study by offering academic, professional and personal advice, guidance and support.
Developing a “CUST Advisory App” will bring the university toward e-learning environment and use it to guide students to plan in their studies and monitor their academic progress.
CUST Advisory App is a mobile based application. By using this application, head advisor could be able to view all the registered student progress. Advisors can view only those students who have been allocated to them through head advisor. Students can view their allocated advisor and can contact them easily.
CUST Advisory App treats all students individually, so that each student can enter, move through, and leave the campus knowing that help and advice is always available for them. Students need to maintain a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 2.0 to stay in good academic standing and to be able graduate from a program. Students placed on academic probation (GPA below 2.0) will receive an official notification from the University through this portal. It is important that academic advisors make contact with these students to help them understand their current academic standing and assist in the implementation of a plan for future success. Academic Advisors can also refer these students, where appropriate, to relevant support services.

5	Domain Introduction
Our project is basically a mobile based application that is calling API to get data from web. The data it receives is it in JSon object and then displays it accordingly.  An internet is required to avail the features of our application and a high speed internet connection is essential because browsers may become unresponsive at low internet connection.

6	Purpose of CUST Advisory App
Purpose of this application is to convert manual system of Advisors to online system. Through our system Head advisor can approve Advisors and assign students to advisor. By this system, advisor didn’t need to ask it from head advisor just need to login system and can see his/her students. Similarly students can get info about advisor by this system. Head advisor can view all advisors of all or specific department and furthermore can email them. Similarly view all students. One more task is to upload records of all students and update it. Head advisor can make announcements to advisors. 
Advisor can view only his/her student’s details like academic and general info. Furthermore, give announcement to his/her students only. 
Students can get info about Advisor. Student can login and see announcements from his/her advisor. Announcement from advisor will also be shown to students inside drawer or also on home page.
So overall by this system, Advisory application will improve too much from a manually system that is in use nowadays.

6	Business Scope

Planning and academic advice is important for every student, with a good academic advice can help students enhance their personality and disciplinary. Besides that, good advising will bring student to clarify, plan, implement and monitor their progress of study which consist their values, goals, interests and abilities.  
As each student will be allocated an Advisor at the start of their studies and each university has a Senior Advisor whose role is to oversee the operation of the advising system in the university. This application is available to all taught students, including visiting and part-time students. The principal mechanism of advising students on campus is face-to-face meetings with their individual academic Adviser.
